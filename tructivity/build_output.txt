Your project is configured to compile against Android SDK 34, but the following plugin(s) require to be compiled against a higher Android SDK version:
- flutter_native_splash compiles against Android SDK 35
- flutter_plugin_android_lifecycle compiles against Android SDK 35
- home_widget compiles against Android SDK 35
- image_picker_android compiles against Android SDK 35
- local_auth_android compiles against Android SDK 35
- path_provider_android compiles against Android SDK 35
- quick_actions_android compiles against Android SDK 35
- shared_preferences_android compiles against Android SDK 35
- url_launcher_android compiles against Android SDK 35
- video_player_android compiles against Android SDK 35
Fix this issue by compiling against the highest Android SDK version (they are backward compatible).
Add the following to D:\Dev\tructivity-Updated\tructivity\android\app\build.gradle:

    android {
        compileSdk = 35
        ...
    }
